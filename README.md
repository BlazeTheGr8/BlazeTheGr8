### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
My name is Adam Castle and I am an aspiring software developer with a special interest in cyber
security and AI. I am proficient in HTML5, CSS , JavaScript as well as
troubleshooting AWS cloud services including the management of
Account Security and Billing. In my last role at AWS I held positions of
leadership and exceeded the quality bar, displaying that I not only bring a
strong work ethic to a team, but also strong leadership skills. I have
always been a forward thinker, a quick learner which gives me an edge for
problem solving, as such, I was recognized as a role model by my
colleagues. l am currently enrolled in a Software Development course to
broaden my skill set where upon completion I will be an entry-level
FullStack Web Developer.
